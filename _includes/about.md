About Me
========

Hi, I'm Brandon. I'm from Irvine, CA, but I'm currently located near UC Berkeley, where I pursue Computer Science and Education. I hope to bring my passion for learning, doing, and teaching wherever I am, to everyone around me. I also plan to develop some cool stuff along the way. I am also an active member in the Cal Marching Band and in the Livingwater Church at Berkeley.
