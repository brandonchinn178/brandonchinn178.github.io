About Me
========
Hello! My name is Brandon Chinn. I am originally from Irvine, CA, where I graduated from Northwood High School. Currently, I am a student at UC Berkeley (Class of '17), where I plan to major in Computer Science. I also plan to pursue Physics and Education in my academic career. In addition to my academics, I am in the Cal Marching Band and a part of the Livingwater Church at Berkeley. For my résumé, please refer to my [R&eacute;sum&eacute;](resume.html) page.
