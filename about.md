# Hey, how's it going?

I'm a software engineer currently based in San Francisco, with a passion for high quality code and sharing knowledge. I have a wide range of experience, from developer tooling like CI and build systems, to full stack web development, to backend Haskell platforms.

One interest I have aside from software development is teaching. I've run a bootcamp for the Haskell programming language at some of the companies I've worked at, with attendees subsequently able to understand and contribute to Haskell codebases. I was also a mentor at Stanford's Code in Place program during COVID-19 to teach Python to people who've never programmed before.

This blog primarily contains posts about Haskell, but it also contains a few posts on non-Haskell topics, programming or otherwise. I also have another blog, [CS With Bad Drawings](https://cswithbaddrawings.wordpress.com), which aims to explain various Computer Science concepts to anyone: layperson or developer.

Please [feel free](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation/) to reach out about anything; I'd be happy to chat about most any topic. You can contact me at `my github username` @ gmail.
